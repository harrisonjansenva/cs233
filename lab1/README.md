## Questions from Part 5:
1. I have Python 3.14 on my machine, but in my pydata-book env, I am running Python 3.11
1. I am a CS Major, so I was expecting qtconsole to be able to run vim and other standard UNIX commands, but touch did not work for me. Everything else worked as expected.
1. If I am running a standard Python program (not a Jupyter notebook), I just use run __.py where __ is the name of the file.
